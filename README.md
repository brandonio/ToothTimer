ToothTimer
==========

Pebble app for timing the brushing of teeth (2 minutes).

It shows different parts of the mouth (upper right outer, lower left inner, etc) with a countdown timer for how long 
to focus on it (currently 15 seconds each), along with a brief delay at the start to get ready, and a brief delay 
halfway through to spit. It vibrates between each step so you don't have to watch the watch while you're brushing.

TODO: add option for brushing duration (eg. change it to 3 minutes).
